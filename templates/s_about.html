<h1>About Page</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>Welcome to the Library Management System Admin About Page. This page provides information about the system and its development.</p>
<p>The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to help librarians manage their library collections and services. The system allows librarians to add, edit, and delete books, manage user accounts, and track borrowing and returning of books.</p>
<p>The system was developed by a team of software engineers using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The team followed the Agile software development methodology, which emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. The team worked closely with librarians to ensure that the system meets their needs and is easy to use.</p>
<p>The system is currently in its beta testing phase and will be released to the public soon. We welcome feedback from librarians and users to help us improve the system and make it more useful.</p>
